## E-commerce funnel
The e-commerce funnel is essential for an online business, as it allows us to understand better how customers behave on the website.
We are looking at the following steps:
- Which products were looked at in detail?
- What products were added to the cart?
- What products were removed from the cart?
- How many of these products end up being purchased?
  
By answering these questions, data-informed decisions can be taken to strive for the web store goals in order to achieve the e-commerce strategy.
