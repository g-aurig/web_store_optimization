# Objectives
The objective of this analytics project is to gain insights with the help of BigQuery &amp; to provide actionable proposals based on the insights with the aim of reaching business growth.

# Results
## Items ecommerce funnel with conversion ratios
The ecommerce funnel for items is highly valuable for an online business because it provides a better understanding of how interactions with products occur on the website.
When looking at the ecommerce steps & ratios based on **session scope** the following questions can be examined:
- What frequency are specific products looked at?
- What products were added to the cart?
- What products were removed from the cart?
- How many of these products end up being purchased?
  
By answering these questions, data-informed decisions can be taken to strive for the web store goals in order to achieve the e-commerce strategy.

The screenshot below shows the visualisation with Looker Studio. In the original state, the table is sorted by the "purchase" column, but can easily be changed towards other metrics.
